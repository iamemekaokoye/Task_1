        <p>Graduating top of my class as a computer science student, I knew i haven't completely been 
            equipped with the necessary skills for the job market. I took some other courses such as design 
            development, brand development, graphics design and recently user interface design. I decided to go
            Web development and this has opened me up to a whole new journey. I look forward to harnessing
            the skill and passion a a creative while connecting and working as a team-player with other
            creatives.</p>
